Small QML game with bugs (ladybugs)

A little game I wrote to reuse the PS4 controller I have. Since QtGamepad is not working with two PS4 controller simultaneously, I used QJoysticks instead - thanks to @alex-spataru for writing it.
My focus when I wrote the game was not on a perfectly clean code, but on experimenting with some techniques, like joystick control (PS controller), collision detection, dynamic object creation, having a model in C++ (at least for the bugs), using a state machine for the game logic, loading/saving high score data, etc.
